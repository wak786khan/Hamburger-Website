        Education in Pakistan is overseen by the Federal Ministry of Education and the provincial governments, while the federal government mostly assists in curriculum development, accreditation and the financing of research and development. Article 25-A of the Constitution of Pakistan obligates the state to provide free and compulsory quality education to children of the age group 5 to 16 years. "The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of five to sixteen years in such a manner as may be determined by law".[3] Considering the challenges confronting the youth in Pakistan, it's hardly astonishing that well-off and educated young individuals and professionals are opting to depart the country whenever they have the opportunity, exacerbating the brain drain phenomenon.[4]
        The education system in Pakistan[5] is generally divided into six levels: preschool (for the age from 3 to 5 years), primary (years one to five), middle (years six to eight), secondary (years nine and ten, leading to the Secondary School Certificate or SSC), intermediate (years eleven and twelve, leading to a Higher Secondary School Certificate or HSSC), and university programs leading to undergraduate and graduate degrees.[6] The Higher Education Commission established in 2002 is responsible for all universities and degree awarding institutes.[7] It was established in 2002 with Atta-ur-Rahman as its Founding Chairman.[8]    </div>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Pakistan still has a low literacy rate relative to other countries.[9] As of 2016 Pakistan's literacy rates range from 82% in Islamabad to 23% in the Torghar District.[10] Literacy rates vary by gender and region. In tribal areas female literacy is 9.5%,[11] while Azad Kashmir has a literacy rate of 74%.[12] Pakistan's population of children not in school (22.8 million children) is the second largest in the world after Nigeria.[13] According to the data, Pakistan faces a significant unemployment challenge, particularly among its educated youth, with over 31% of them being unemployed. Moreover, women account for 51% of the overall unemployed population, highlighting a gender disparity in employment opportunities.[14] Pakistan produces about 445,000 university graduates and 25,000 to 30,000 computer science graduates per year As of 2021.[15]

          A primary school in a village in the Sindh region
          Only about 67.5% of Pakistani children finish primary school education.[16] The standard national system of education is mainly inspired from the English educational system. Pre-school education is designed for 3–5 years old and usually consists of three stages: Play Group, Nursery and Kindergarten (also called 'KG' or 'Prep'). After pre-school education, students go through junior school from years 1 to 5. This is followed by middle school from years 6 to 8. At middle school, single-sex education is usually preferred by the community, but co-education is also common in urban cities. The curriculum is usually subject to the institution. The eight commonly examined disciplines are:</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">curriculum is usually subject to the institution. The eight commonly examined disciplines are:

          Arts
          Computer Studies and ICT
          General Science (including Physics, Chemistry and Biology)
          Modern languages with literature i.e. Urdu and English
          Mathematics
          Religious Education i.e. Islamic Studies
          Social Studies (including Civics, Geography, History, Economics, Sociology and sometimes elements of law, politics and PHSE)
          Most schools also offer drama studies, music and physical education but these are usually not examined or marked. Home economics is sometimes taught to female students, whereas topics related to astronomy, environmental management and psychology are frequently included in textbooks of general science. Sometimes archaeology and anthropology are extensively taught in textbooks of social studies. SRE is not taught at most schools in Pakistan although this trend is being rebuked by some urban schools. Provincial and regional languages such as Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashto and others may be taught in their respective provinces, particularly in language-medium schools. Some institutes give instruction in foreign languages such as German, Turkish, Arabic, Persian, French and Chinese. The language of instruction depends on the nature of the institution itself, whether it is an English-medium school or an Urdu-medium school.

          As of 2009, Pakistan faces a net primary school attendance rate for both sexes of 66%, a figure below estimated world average of 90 per cent.[17]
          
          An English textbook dialogue:
          "Mother: Ali,...not going to pray today?
          Ali: Mama,...not feeling well.
          Mother: ..you are grown up now,
          ..should not miss your prayers.
          Ali: Mama! Why do we pray?
          Mother: Because ...to thank ALLAH
          Almighty for His blessings.
          Ali: Can't we skip prayers
          even for a single day?
          Mother: No, we cannot.
          Ali: Ok mama. I'll not skip...
          Mother: Good..."
          
          ~English Textbook of
          Punjab Textbook Board
          of Year 8 in Pakistan
          [18]
          
          As of 2007, public expenditure on education was 2.2 percent of GNPs, a marginal increase from 2 percent before 1984–85. Very little (only about 12%) of the total national allocation to education goes to higher education with about 88% being spent on lower level education. Lower education institutions such as primary schools suffer under such conditions as the lower income classes are unable to enjoy subsidies and quality education.[19]
          
          Secondary education
          
          Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education office in Islamabad
          Secondary education in Pakistan begins in year 9 and lasts for four years. After end of each of the school years, students are required to pass a national examination administered by a regional Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (or BISE).
          
          Upon completion of year 9, students are expected to take a standardised test in each of the first parts of their academic subjects (SSC-I). They again take these tests of the second parts of the same courses at the end of year 10 (SSC-II). Upon successful completion of these examinations, they are awarded a Secondary School Certificate (or SSC). This is locally termed a 'matriculation certificate' or 'matric' for short. The curriculum usually includes a combination of eight courses including electives (such as Biology, Chemistry, Computer and Physics) as well as compulsory subjects (such as Mathematics, English, Urdu, Islamic studies and Pakistan Studies). The total marks for Matric are 1100 divided between 9th and 10th.[20] The marks are divided in each year follows: 75 marks for Maths, English and Urdu, 50 marks for Islamic Studies (or ethics for Non Muslim students) and Pakistan Studies, 65 marks for Sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Physics). An additional 90 marks are allotted for practicals (30 for each science). Students then enter an intermediate college and complete year 11 and 12. Upon completion of each of the two years, they again take standardised tests in their academic subjects (HSSC-I and HSSC-II). Upon successful completion of these examinations, students are awarded the Higher Secondary School Certificate (or HSSC). This level of education is also called the FSc/FA/ICS or 'intermediate'. There are many streams students can choose for their 11 and 12 years, such as pre-medical, pre-engineering, humanities (or social sciences), computer science and commerce. Each stream consists of three electives and as well as three compulsory subjects of English, Urdu, Islamiat (year 11 only) and Pakistan Studies (year 12 only).
          
          Alternative qualifications in Pakistan are available but are maintained by other examination boards instead of BISE. Most common alternative is the General Certificate of Education (or GCE), where SSC and HSSC are replaced by Ordinary Level (or O Level) and Advanced Level (or A Level) respectively. Other qualifications include IGCSE which replaces SSC. GCE and GCSE O Level, IGCSE and GCE AS/A Level are managed by British examination boards of CIE of the Cambridge Assessment and/or Edexcel International of the Pearson PLC. Generally, 8–10 courses are selected by students at GCE O Levels and 3–5 at GCE A Levels.
          
          Advanced Placement (or AP) is an alternative option but much less common than GCE or IGCSE. This replaces the secondary school education as 'High School Education' instead. AP exams are monitored by a North American examination board, College Board, and can only be given under supervision of centers which are registered with the College Board, unlike GCE O/AS/A Level and IGCSE which can be given privately.
          
          Another type of education in Pakistan is called "Technical Education" and combines technical and vocational education. The vocational curriculum starts at year 5 and ends with year 10.[21] Three boards, the Punjab Board of Technical Education (PBTE), KPK Board of Technical Education (KPKBTE) and Sindh Board of Technical Education (SBTE) offering Matric Tech. course called Technical School Certificate (TSC) (equivalent to 10th grade) and Diploma of Associate Engineering (DAE) in engineering disciplines like Civil, Chemical, Architecture, Mechanical, Electrical, Electronics, Computer etc. DAE is a three years program of instructions which is equivalent to 12th grade. Diploma holders are called associate engineers. They can either join their respective field or take admission in B.Tech. and BE in their related discipline after DAE.</p>
